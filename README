This script can used primarily for interop functionality between 
Subversion and CounterSoft Gemini, for delivering GNU/Linux and possibly 
other platform compatibility

It uses a YAML file for loading information, typically stored in the
hooks folder, together with this script. The YAML file should have four
specific entries:

* <tt>username</tt>: Containing the proxy username for subversion in Gemini
* <tt>password or api</tt>: Either the password or the api key generated by 
                            Gemini
* <tt>url</tt>: The url of the Gemini server, accepting both http as well 
                as https
* _Optional_ <tt>svn_remote_url</tt>: The remote url of subversion used 
                                      by normal clients

Within the post-hook an entry should be added similar to:

<tt>"$REPOS"/hooks/svngeminibridge "$1" "$2"</tt>

Make sure that the execute bit is set

== Prerequisites ==

* Access to the /tmp path
* The [+svn+] command should be in the path
* The [svngeminibridge.yaml] file should be accessible
