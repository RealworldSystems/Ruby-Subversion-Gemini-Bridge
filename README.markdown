This script can used primarily for interop functionality between 
Subversion and CounterSoft Gemini, for delivering GNU/Linux and possibly 
other platform compatibility

It uses a YAML file for loading information, typically stored in the
hooks folder, together with this script. The YAML file should have four
specific entries:

* `username`: Containing the proxy username for subversion in Gemini
* `password or api`: Either the password or the api key generated by Gemini
* `url`: The url of the Gemini server, accepting both http as well as https
* _Optional_ `svn_remote_url`: The remote url of subversion used by normal clients

Within the post-hook an entry should be added similar to:

`"$REPOS"/hooks/svngeminibridge "$1" "$2"`

Make sure that the execute bit is set

Prerequisites
=============

* Access to the `/tmp` path
* The `svn` command should be in the path
* The `svngeminibridge.yaml` file should be accessible
